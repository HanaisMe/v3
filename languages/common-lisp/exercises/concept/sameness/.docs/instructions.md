Leslie the Lisp Alien is programming their maze-robot (as young Lisp Aliens are wont to do) and needs some help. The maze consists of a series of rooms. Each room as a choices of doors. Each door needs a key. If you use the wrong key at a door it is likely to explode (do not worry for the robot, there will be no damage but buffing out the scorch marks is quite annoying for Leslie). If the robot doesn't have a key to open any doors then the whole room will explode! (Again, do not worry it will not damage but will be annoying to clean.)

What you need to help Leslie with is to program her robot to pick the correct key for each room. In each room the robot will try the key in each door in order until it finds one that the key opens. It will then go through the door and find out what lies behind it.

Each test represents a maze and each assertion is a room. You need to add clauses to the `case` expression in the `robot` function so that it evaluates to the correct equality predicate. For example if there was a room called `:room-of-big-numbers` and you wanted the key for that room to be `eql` then you should add `(:room-of-big-numbers #'eql)` to the `case` expression.
